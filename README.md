CCRC Fun seminar: A brief introduction to LaTeX - 25th March 2024

These are the files I used live in the seminar on overleaf. The fun_introduction.tex file shows you how to
- set up a preamble
- include title, author, affiliations
- abstract & plain language summary
- section your manuscript
- include figures, equations and tables in your document

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
